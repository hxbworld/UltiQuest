## Welcome to UltiQuest

This is a new generation of text-based RPGs. UltiQuest is based on [this](https://finalrealm.weebly.com/).
UltiQuest will have everything a regular open-world RPG would have; trainable skills, a full economy system (banking, gambling, loans), diseases, a random (but level based) adventure and dungeon system for high-risk, high-reward loot, magic and combat, save states (with optional password protection), and even a time system.

## But.. when?

Right now we are in the very early stages of development, however this Github repository will be updated frequently; we want to be completely transparent with our developmental progress. 

This is a huge undertaking, and will probably take a while before there is a working public beta release. 

## Compatability

UltiQuest will be written entirely in DOS, on a Windows 10 machine, so we recommend using Windows 10 if you're playing. However, this is not to say that it will not work on earlier versions of Windows; we use very simple strings to remove complexity on our developers and to increase compatibility as much as possible.

## Linux?

In short, no. In length.. maybe. It really depends on how much interest is actually gathered for the project. We're doing this completely for free, it is a side project for most of us, and we simply don't have the resources currently to develop UltiQuest for Linux (or Mac). Eventually I would like to make this project cross-platform, however this is a long ways off and may never actually happen.
